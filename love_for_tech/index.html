            <h1>My Love for technology</h1>
            <p>My name is <strong>Asimolowo Adeyera</strong>, My love for technology started a few years ago,what I love most about technology is that <i>technology never stops evolving</i> , the idea of being able to innovate something now, which can be useful now and later in the future is fascinating. Technology has impacted lives and it has made life easier for people. I can't imagine a life without telephone, I would have to write a letter which might take days to get to the receiver, just to pass an information which can be done within seconds through phone. </p>

        <h2>What I have learnt so far</h2>
        <p>So far, I have learnt how to code using HTML and CSS, HTML is an acronym for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>, It is the structure of a page, I like to call HTML the skeleton of a page, It is used to create the structures of a page, the contents like texts we all see in a webpage are created using HTML.</p>
        <p>
            CSS is an acronym for <em>Cascading style sheet</em>, CSS is used to style a webpage, css is important in a webpage because it brings life to the page, with CSS we can add colours to our page, we can manipulate our texts,we can change the way our texts are, we can beautify every single thing on the page, we can style our pictures, we can style our page to our liking, we can even add animations.

        <h2>Differences between Paddings, Margins and Border</h2>
        <p>
            Padding is the space between the contents and the border. For instance, if i draw box and I write some texts in the box, the little space between my texts and the line of my box is called the padding. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Margin is the space around the border. For instance, if i draw box and I write some texts in the box, the space outside my box is called the margin.
        </p>
        <p>
            Border is the line around my box
